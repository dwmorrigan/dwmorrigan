- 👋 Hello! I am @dwmorrigan
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general, with a specific interest in Python. I also enjoy fantasy novels, with a love for bad vampire stories. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me: Never by phone.
- I started programming in BASIC on a C64. After that I jumped around with first Pascal, C, PH, JavaScript, and finally Java & Python. I'm currently working towards my BS in IT with a concentration in software development at SNHU.
