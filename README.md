# Hello! My name is Danforth Morrigan. 
 - I am currently a senior at Southern New Hampshire University, working towards a BS in Information Technology.
 - I am looking forward to working as a software engineer.
 - In the time between deciding that and now, I took a long detour through manufacturing. I have a lot of stories about working in a plant and quite a few of them are horror stories.
