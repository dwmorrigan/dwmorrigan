# Hello! I am Danforth and:
 - I graduated in September 2024 from Southern New Hampshire University with Bachelors in IT, concentrating on Software Development.
 - I am currently looking for entry level positions as a software developer.
 - I also love playing with tech. For me this includes buidling personal PCs, creating a home lab with several RaspberryPis, and "testing" all the cheap bluetooth headphones my wallet can afford.
