# Hello! I am DW and:
 - I just graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with Bachelors in IT, concentrating on Software Development.
 - I am currently looking for entry level coding positions, but I've handicapped myself by living in remote Vermont.
 - I also love playing with tech. For me this includes buidling personal PCs, creating a home lab with several RaspberryPis, and "testing" all the cheap bluetooth headphones my wallet can afford.

## My current "best" cheap bluetooth headphones:

[Redmi Buds 3 Lite](https://www.mi.com/global/product/redmi-buds-3-lite/) which I got from [Temu: Redmi Buds 3 Lite](https://share.temu.com/a23Lq4DokLA) for $14.99 in May, 2024. I got them when my Skullcandy Push Active's completely their disappointing disintegration, deciding to give a Redmi a go again after having a great experience with their AirDots 2. They sound good, hold a good charge, connect easily, and fit comfortably.
