# Hello! My name is Danforth Morrigan. 
 - I am currently a junior at Southern New Hampshire University, working towards a BS in Information Technology.
 - I want to work as a programmer. That's what it was called when I was a kid and decided that this was what I wanted to do.
 - In the time between deciding that and now, I took a long detour through manufacturing. I have a lot of stories about working in a plant and quite a few of them are horror stories.
